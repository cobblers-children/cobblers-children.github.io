    <h1>The Cobbler's Children have no Shoes</h1>
    <p>
        There is an old phrase, it has appeared in <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/159004/the-cobblers-children-have-no-shoes">different forms
        in perhaps a dozen languages</a>, but the sentiment is all the same:  Since you do a thing for a living, 
        'someday' you will do the thing properly for yourself and your family, but 'for now' you save all your best 
        effort for your customers.  
    </p>

    <h1>We Are All the Cobbler's Children</h1>

    <p>
        In software, we also save our best work for our customers.  Unfortunately <em>we also use software to make</em>
        software. "Someday" rarely comes, and for decades some of the worst designed pieces of software you could 
        encounter were developer tools. Good Enough has ruled the day for a long time, and only in recent years have 
        things changed very much.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am looking for like-minded individuals.  People who understand the multiplicative effect on productivity that
        a good tool offers, and the subtle ways that an otherwise good tool can undo its own advantages.  I'd like to
        find other people who count the cost of using their tools against the 'accidental complexity' of their projects
        and are incentivized to find better options or make improvements to existing ones.
    </p>

    <p>
        What I hope to do is create a small group of people, probably full stack developers, who understand Human 
        Factors but can also contribute substantially to tools development.  I'm hoping to organize people to identify
        developer tools that are <em>almost</em> good and cooperate to fix them, and other tools that need better 
        alternatives and work together to create them.
